Currently, it contains only one tutorial from the IMPRS Heidelberg Summer School. This repository will be updated with other content when it is available.

## 18th IMPRS Heidelberg Summer School: "Unraveling Galaxy Evolution with JWST"
[**IMPRS_JWST_School_MIRI.ipynb**](./IMPRS_JWST_School_MIRI.ipynb) contains a tutorial given on September 5, 2024, by Oleg Egorov during the hands-on session at the school. 
This tutorial covers several aspects of processing JWST MIRI images of nearby galaxies. The tutorial is based on the recent [PHANGS-JWST](https://phangs.org) data. Most recipes are included in the PHANGS-JWST pipeline [pjpipe](https://github.com/PhangsTeam/pjpipe). This tutorial covers:
- PSF matching of the images
- Creation of convolution kernels with WebbPSF
- Anchoring of the absolute flux calibration and improvements of background subtraction
- Matching JWST/MIRI images and VLT/MUSE optical data
- Analysis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) distribution in the ISM of galaxies
- Creation of the nice-looking color images with [multicolorfits](https://github.com/pjcigan/multicolorfits)
